# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Project: Around the U.S

In this project, you will learn multiple aspects that were introduced in sprint 3 such as; Figma, Display: Grid, responsive webs( how your designs look different in other devices) and also introduces you on how you will be creating a digital products and put you briefly in the world of a designer and much more.

As mentioned, this project makes you create your coding from scratch, but more than that it allows you to start being creative and responsive towards your design. I think it's a great way to introduce us to how a software engineer can help in the digital world. Some of the technologies that were used was adaptive and responive webs based on the size of the screen, mobile vs desktop etc. Grid helped make a lot of the requests more responsives.
